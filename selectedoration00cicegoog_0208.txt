lor jury duty who was invested with any oi the lrigher offices ol state,
or who had ever been convicted oi any offence aflectiug his standing

to be tribuni aerarii, district presidents. Not rnueh is known about ·

1v. A suit was hegun by the accuser making application ιο the ii.
judge oi the proper court ior leave to bring the charge. As two or
more persons might desire to prosecute the same man on the same
charge, it was sometimes necessary ior the judge to decide who
should be the chief accuser (accusator), arrd who the supporters (aub-
scrt'ptores). When this had been deterrrrined by due inquiry (divina-
tio), the chief accuser made the formal charge proruere detrrlit); and
the judge, having first notitied the accused (reus), and made sure that
the accuser was a Roman citizen, duly registered the case (nomen

arr interval oi ten days, and had the accused arrested and held ior
trial, or admitted him to bail.

iurors was chosen by lot irorrr those not already engaged iu other
trials, but the accuser and accused had the privilege ol challenging
(reiectio) a certain number without assigning any cause. The re-
maining (coralium iudicum) were swom, and tho trial commenced.

(altercatio) were finished, and the evidence was all in. Tho judge §9-
then called upon the J'urors ior their verdlct, and apparently rcnewed
their oaths. Each juror wrote his decision (sententio) secrctly upon
atablet in one of three forms: A. (obsoleo), ‘not guilty;’ C. (con-
demno), ‘guilty3' or N. L. (non liquet), ‘not proven! The verdlct
was determined by a majority oi votes, or, ii there was a tie, the
verdlct was given in favor ol the defendant. 1r the majority voted
N. L, the ease was tried again; otherwise, there was no appeal from
the judgment ol agnoettio.
