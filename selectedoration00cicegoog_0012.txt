'sius edition of Cicero's Orations and Letters is intended
for the use of secondary schools. lt differs in several respecta

even in chronological order, requires a more minute acquaint

“ease'' “merit'' oi “interest'’ I have, therefore, tried to
lessen a difficulty which Ι could not wholly remove, by limit

spiracy of Catiline as the main theme, following it up with
Cicero's Exile and his Feiid with Clodius The period covered
is only from one-third¹ to one-half as long as the usual one,
and is the most interesting in the life of Cicero. The orations

given are arranged in chronological order: Agaiust Catilina,
