ms EXILE AND RETURN·

nt this crisis it happened that Clodius and Milo met by
accident upon the vio Appia a few miles from the city, each
attended by his gang of bullies and roughs. A quari-el
began among their followers‚ and a free fight followed
Clodius was wounded and took refuge in a house near the
road, from which by Milo's orders he was dragged and mun-
dered. His body was carried to the city, and his funeral was
made the occasion of a disorderly political demonstration y
The corpse was burned in the senate house, and the building
itself took fire and was consumed. Anarohy ran riot, and
order was not restored until Pompeius, in defiance of consti·
tution and laws, was made “sole consul '' and put an end to
the battle of bludgeons with the swords of his soldiers

Tun Onarrou non Mina-A special cornmission was90
appointed to try all cases growing out of the disturhauce
on the Appian Way, and all the members of this commission
or court were selected by Pompeius. At the same time
all men capable of service in Italy were called to arms and ’
made to take the oath of obedience to Pompeius. Troops
were stationed at the Capitol, and the special court, sitting
in the forum, was snrrounded by soldiers. Before this
court on the 10th of April Milo was arraigned on the
charge of assanlt and homicide. Cicero undertook his
defense for personal and politioal reasons. As he began
his speech he was received with hoots and yells by the par·
tisans of Clodius which the troops were unable to suppress.
The consequence was that, for the first time in his long
career, he lost his composnre and broke down. Milo went
into exile at Massilia, whither Cicero sent him a carefully
polished (ξ 10) copy of the speech which he had intended
to deliver, and which we now possess. Milo is said to have
replied on reading it that he was glad the speech had not
been spoken‚as in that case he should not have been enjoy-
ing the delicious mullets of Massilia. The oration in its
revised form is regarded as perhaps the ver)⁷ best specimen
of Cicero's eloquenoe.
