himself men of all parties, especially Cicero's personal or
politieal enemies. He won the favor of the poor by his
corn-law, gratified many knights and even senators by
limiting the power of the censors (pta, 556), aud paved
the way for his favorite politioal tactics by abrogating the
law which had put a cheok upon tumultuous assemblies of
the people, and by restoring the suppressed ward clubs. 'te
As soon as he had thus secured a following upon which he
could rely, he came forward early iu 58, in the consulship

until a direct attack was made upon him3 L. Lucullus
in particular was eager to resort to force iu his behalf,
kuowing that the great mass of moderate and peaceful citi-
zens‚ especially those in the country towns, were devoted
to him. But others, among them many of his sincerest
friends, counseled temporary submission, encouraging him
to hope ior an immediate recall. Το these Cicero yielded,
