but was afterwards restored. To him Catilina attached 35
himself, and both resolved to leave untried no means ofcan-
missing, lawful or unlawful, to defeat Cicero- of the other
candidates they had no fears Catilina found friends to
assist him with their money and credit in the purchase of
votes, and at the expense of other friends shows of gladia x
tors were promised the people'in his name. finally, in

dune Catilina called together his trusted adherents and
laid before them his plens and the means of executing
them. 'fo the ambitious he promised high positions in the
statc‚to the bankrupt complete or partial relief by legisla-
tion‚ to all alike the rich spoil of an unscrnpulous adminis-
tration and the plunder of the provinces. All was condi·
tioned of course upon his success in the electiori of the
following month3 and so, after ratifying their engagements
with the most fearful oaths (itis said that they pledged
each other in wine mixed with human blood), they separ-
ated to work, each in his own way, for the electiori of
Catilina and Antonius
C1oneo’s Consors—While Catilina was indulging inas

the most confident hopeS, the prospects of Cicero were by
no means bright. He could count certainly upon the sup·
port of the knights only—the order to which his own
family belonged. For however great the reputation he had
made as an orator, advocate, and administrator, however
high he stood in the affections of the people‚ however pure
his character was amidst the moral filth of the time, how·
ever persuasively he urged his own claims, and however
eloquently he exposed the designs of his opponents, still
the arts of his competitors were strong with the lower
classes, and the nobility was solidly against him. The
nobles despised him as a homo cocos (p. 56, ἓ 16), hated him
for his attacks upon them in his speeches against Verres
and for the Maniliae law (§23), and feared that in the
future he might work in the interests of the¹ democratS,
and further the ambitious designs of Pompeius.
