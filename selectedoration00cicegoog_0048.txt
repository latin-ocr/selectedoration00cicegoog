Dyrrachium and offered his hospitality. At his house, not
far from Thessalonica, Cicero lived in security but in deep
dejectiori. He apprehended that his brother Quintus, then

returning from his administrationes Asia, might be perse·

day, drove away the friends of Cicero and spread terror
through the streets. The tribunes Sestius and Milo adopted
