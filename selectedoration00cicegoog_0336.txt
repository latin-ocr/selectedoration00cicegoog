remarkable. The tabellarii travelled from iorty to filtymilesa day

in carts, and fr'om twenty-six to twenty-seven on ioot. Under favor·
able conditions much better time was possible: a'letter could go from
Rome to Brundisium (three hundred and seventy atili. pass.) in five ·
days, on ιο Dyrrhachium in five more, reaching Athens in twenty-one
days from its departure3 and letters irorn Caesar in Britain reached
Cicero ln Rome ln from twenty-seven to thirty-four days. In the time

oi Washington amonth was the usual time for a letter to take in going
from the Eastern ιο the Sonthern states in winter.

11. Wnrrme Marnnrans For ordinary brief communicatione 54,
the Romans used tablets (tabellae) made oi lirwood or ivery. These
were of various sines, fastened together in sets of two or more by wire
hinges. The inner iaces were slightly hollowed out, and the depres-
sion was nearly filled with wax, so as ιο leave a raised rim about the
edges. Upon the wax letters were traced withan ivory or metal tool
(stilus, propitum) having one end pointed like a peneil lor writing, and
the other dat, like a paper-cutter, for smoothing the wax. With this
flat end mistakes could be corrected, or the whole letter erased and
the tabellae prepared for use on other occasions.

For longer communicatione another material (perieras) was used, 55,
resembling our paper, but rough and coarse. It was made from the
reed of the same name, obtained in Egypt. Upon this papyrus, or
charta, they wrote with a pen made oi a split reed (calamos) and ink
(atramentum) made οι soot mixed with resinous gums. The ink
could be washed off with a damp sponge, which the writer kept by
himforthe correction oi errors. The tendency oi the poor inlr to
blot and spread upon the poorer paper accounts for the continued use
of the bulky tabellae.

These rude writing materiale, and the extensive correspondence §d
carried on by every Roman oi birth and position, made lt impossible
lor him to write any but the most important oi his letters, or those to
his dearest friends, with his own hand. The place of the stenogrspber
and typevvriter of to-day was taken by slaves or freedmen, often
highly educated, who wrote at the dictation of the master. Such
slaves were called in general terms librarii, more particularly aerei ab
epistolis, servi o manu, or amanuenses.

letter, -the date, address, salutation, body, complimentary close, and
signature, -the address and complimentary close are entirely want-
ing in Latin letters, and the date is but rarely given. The delivery
of the letters by special rnessengers (5 l) made the date and address
less necessary than now, and the straightforwardness ol the Latin
language knew no such meaningless phrases as our ‘your obedient
servant,’ ‘yonrstruly,’ ‘yours, ete.’

The narn when expressed will be found at the end of the §8.
