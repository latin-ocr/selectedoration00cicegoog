the power 01 Rome upon the seas, while Lucullus fought
against Mithradates and Tigranes in the east, Cicero was
daily busy in the forum, always at the service 01 011 who
needed his assistance. Nona 01 the speecheS, however,
which 110 delivered 111 these years (75-72) have corne down

70 us.

’ Hrs Annrnnsnrr. -Cicero's politica] attitude up to 7111018
time is very uncertain. He seems to have acquiesced in
the triumph 01 Sulla as an earnest 01 peace and order, but

to have revolted at the tyranny and cruelty 01 the dictator.
Neither arc we thoroughly acquainted with his relations to
Pompeius, the spoiled favorite 01 the senate, who had re· Ι
turned victorious from Spain in 71, had quarrelled immedi-
ately with his party, had newertheless gained the consulship

in 70, and had set about 7110 undoing 01 Sulla's constitution.
But we do know that Cicero, who in 70 was elected aedile
(p. 66, ξ 64 1.) 10169, took advantage of 7110 trial 01 Gaius
Verres to pose as the zealous champion 01 the people’s
rights. Verres had been propraetor of Sicily for 71110019
yearS, and had shamefully abused and plundered the prov·
iuce. On the expiration 01 his term 01 office 7110 Sicilians
brought suit against him 1010170171011, laying damages at
62606000. Bound bya promise given during his quaestor·
ship Cicero departed from his custom and undertook their
case, thus appearing 101 the first time as prosecutor in a
public cause. He made the case a political one by publish-
ing through Rome his intention to proceed against Verres
not as an individual but as a type. He promised tc expose 20
in this trial the corruption 01 the senates system 01 ad·
ministering the provinces, which had made the title 01
governor a synonym 101 plunderer and extortioner. He
also promised to unccver the rottenness 01 the senatorial
courts which had regularly acquitted offenders notoriously

as guilty as Verres, and had unblushingly divided with
thern the spoil. The case 01 Verres is closely connected

with the proceedings 01 Pompeius against the senate.
