msa OF CICERO.

made for every speech the most careful and conscier
preparation, and handled his subjects with the mosl
summata skill. He could confuse a thing when he ‹
and weave a web of sophistry almost impossible to ι
langle. What he wished to make clear he could put i
simplest, plainest, most forcible way, and he generall
eit in the shortest sentences. He could be humorous, s:
tic, pathetic, ironical, satirical, and when he was mally

others in a fragmentary condition. We do not have tj
however, in the precise form in which they were deliw
because it was his custom to prepare his speeches for
licatiou by removing the parts of less permanent inte

and revising the rest.
