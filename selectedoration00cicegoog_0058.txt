tically no burdens imposed by citizenship. The citizen was
theoretioally liable for military duty irom his llth to his
cuth year, and to pay atax if such was found necessary in
time of war. Since the time of Marius, however, citizens

no longer served in the army against their will, and the rich ¹
revenues from the provinces made taxation unnecessary even

in time of war. ¹

Entirely outside the pale oi citizenship, and forming, of9
course, no part of the Populus Romanos, were two numerous
elements in the population of the city, foreigners (Pcrc-
prr‘ai) aud slaves (Servi). The persons and property of
the former were secured by law, though they might at any
time be removed from the city by vote of the people. Slaves
were looked upon as mere property, and had no rights oi
any sort.

ΙΙ. Onnes Drsrrnorrons-Altbough the government of 10
Rome is called republican, and although the old distinction
between patriciana and plebeians had long since ceased to be
of politioal importaucc, still there were differences of posi-
tion between eveu the cives optimo iore that are entirely
foreign to our ideas of republican equality. The govern- 11
ment was really aristocrati03 and the preservation of its
democratic features was due solely to the fact that there
were two aristocracies, one of office-holders and the othcr
of capitalistS, which struggled most bitterly with each other
during the last years of the Republic.

a. The Noblcr. -The Roman nobility was now an 12
hereditary rank, based not upon birth but upon the hold·
ing of office. Any man who held any curule office, i.e.,
any dictator, consul, censor, praetor, or curule aedile, secured
to his descendants to the last generation the right (ius
imaginum) to display in their halls and carry at funerals a
wax mask representing his features. The possession of 13
such a mask, or in other words descent from a curule
magistrate, was the patent of nobility, and all descendants
of curule magistrates were, therefore, nobles (nobiles).
