§lu v1. lt will be noticed immediately that this procedure differs
widely from ours. There was no professionally trained judge to siit
the evidence, and sum it up for the jury. The quaesitores were
changed from year to year, and the praetore at least were more apt to

§lt be skilful politicians than learned jurists. There was no class of pro·
fessional advocates taking fees and living by their profession. Any
citizen might accuse or defend any other, and, as a high reputation as
a successful pleader helped a manto political distinction, many did
so. Thus the relations of counsel to clients rested more than now

512. upon the grounds of personal feeling. Again it not infrequently
happened that collusion existed between the accuser and the accused.
The former frequently played into the hands of the latter by sup
pressing evidence, and conducting the case without energy (praevari-
catio), and hence the chief security for an honest prosecution lay in

§ld the personal hostility of the two. Then no bounds were set to the
matter of an advocate’s speech. The time might be limited by
the judge or by agreement, but the only rneasure of relevancy was
the patience of the jury. It is saie to say that a modern judge would
not allow half of any oi Cicero's speeches to reach the ears of the
J’ury. Lord Brougham declares that not one-sixth of the oration for
Archias would be admissible in an English court. Great importance
was therefore attached to an advocate’s skill asan orator, and as
much, perhaps, to his personal influence with the jur'y, and his posi·

ς 14. tion in the state. Other means, too, were employed to work upon the
feelings of the jury. The accused was attended by crowds of friends3
his wife, children, and parents surrounded him, aud he and they wore
old and filthy garments as a sign of mourning. Iniluential men
were secured to testify in general terms to his character, mernorials
were presented from distant communities, and deputatione were often

515. present throughout the trial. Finally, bribery was too common to
excite surprise, and ¹was made all the easier because the jury was
accessible to the agents of both parties instead oi being kept spart
aa nov. We may therefore conclude that while the Roman criminal
law was administered more expeditiously than ours, it was not free
from objectionable features.
