the right of serving on juries, which had formerly belonged ¹
to the senatorial order exclusively, to those persons not
senators who were worth not less than 400,000 sesterces
(320‚000). This gave the state a new order3 and the nobles,
prevented by law from 'engaging in trade—found themselves
confronted by an aristocracy of wealth, which they in
turnexcluded from political preferment Το this second 20
order the name Ordo Equester was given, not that it had
anything to do with military service, but because its census
(400,000 sesterces) was the same that had in early times
entitled a citizen to serve in the cavalry. The iasiqae'e of
the knights were a gold ring and the⁴ tunica caqustielcue‘e
(with two narrow purple stripes). ’

ο. The Gemmeus. —Below the Nobles and the Knights 21
came the great mass of the citizens, the Commoris. They
did not really form an order, had no insignia, and no dis-
tinctive name. They were called slightingly the Plebs,
and flatteringlythe Populus, but there were powerful
plebeiam families among the knights and nobles, and both
these classes were also covered by the name Populus. 'rhem
condition of the commons in Cicero's time was pitiable.
'l'he combinatione oi capital shut them out oi commerce
and manufacture, while the competition of slave labor

almost closed agriculture and the trades against them.
Some found employment in the colonies and provinces,

some eked out a scanty living on their farms, some made
war their trade3 but the idle and degraded flooked into the
capital to live on the cheap corn provided by the treasury,
and to sell their votes to the highest bidden ⁸
It must be remembered‚ however, that no citizen was2s

absolutely excluded from either oi the ordines. The
meanest citizen could become a‘Knight by amassing the
required sum of 400‚000 sesterces, and the poorest could
make himself a senator and his descendants noble by beat·
ing the senatorial candidate fora quaestorship, and then
gaining a curule office.
