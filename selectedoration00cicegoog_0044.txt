Tua Arrana or Cuomus. — But toward the close of the 73
year 62 occurred a circumstance that excited party strife
again, and exercised the most baneful influeuce over
Cicero's later fortunas. P. Clodius Pulcher (i 33), a young
man of ancient aud noble family, but guilty of all sorts of
excesses, in prosecution of an intrigue with Caesar's wife,
ventured to disguise himself as a dancing-girl, and steal
into Caesar's official residence at the time when the myster-
ies of the Bono Dee, at which the presence of men was
strictly forbidden, were being celebrated there. Caesar
was then pontifex maximus (ξ 39), but absent as propraetor
in Spain. Clodius was· detected, but escaped. The high
priests declared the act sacrilegious, aud required the
matrons end vesteis to repeat the rites. Besides this tho
senate ordered a judicial inquiry, and for the purpose of
securing greater rigor resolved that the jurors should be
selected by the praetor, end not, as was usual, be drawn by

senate was defeated. The jurors were selected by lot, and
the money of Crassus, who, in concert with Caesar, used
every opportunity to humiliate the senate, secured the
ecquittal of Clodius by a vote of thirtyone to twenty-five.
Cicero had from the beginning championed the cause of
the senate, but without personal bitterness toward Clodius.
Now, however, for reasons unknown to us, he suddenly be-

but after the verdict was rendered he let uo opportunity
pase to twit him with the crime and the trial. Clodius
soon went· to Sicily as quaestor, but he had resolved on
revenge, and was merely biding his time.
